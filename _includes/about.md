Welcome to my home on the web. I plan to use this space to capture some of my thoughts, a great majority of which may have little to no practical application.

Professionally, I’m currently **instrumenting**, **managing**, and **analyzing** data at [Maker’s Row](http://makersrow.com/) in Brooklyn, NY.

Maker’s Row is an online marketplace connecting product-based businesses with American manufacturers. Our mission is to make the manufacturing process simple to understand an easy to access.

Prior to Maker’s Row I also focused on data & analytics, working in the information services space at [RISI](http://risiinfo.com/) from 2011 to 2014 and [GlobalSpec](http://globalspec.com/) from 2007 to 2010.

I graduated with a dual degree in Management & Economics from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://rpi.edu/) in 2009, concentrating in management information systems.

I consult. Need help? [Reach out](mailto:tim.finkel@gmail.com).

Outside of work I like to cook with my trusty cast iron skillet, stay fit (especially by running), golf, and watch the Boston Bruins, a bad habit I picked up while living there.

Want to get in touch? Feel free to [email me](mailto:tim.finkel@gmail.com) or [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/king_fink).
